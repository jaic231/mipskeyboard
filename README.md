# mipskeyboard
Piano keyboard that can play, record, and demo music. Written in assembly language. 

Run the .jar file, then go to File -> Open, and open keyboard.asm. Click build from the buttons towards the top, and then click the green play button. 

From there, click 'p' to play anything, 'd' to demo the pre-recorded song, 'r' to record and save what you play, and 'q' to quit and exit the program.

Here's a picture of the keyboard layout:
